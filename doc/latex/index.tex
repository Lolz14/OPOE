The OPE (Orthonormal Polynomial Expansion) library provides a comprehensive framework for option pricing and financial modeling using orthonormal polynomial expansions and stochastic differential equations (SDEs).It includes various financial models, numerical integration techniques, and polynomial manipulation utilities.

It provides tools to price options using Monte\+Carlo simulations, closed formulae and Fourier-\/based methods.
